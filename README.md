# FRC-Reloaded

I messed up the last repository. This is a new one that I'm setting up with Terminal (which means I can directly upload to github without having to use the website). 

Purpose: we will share files here. This is the place where we can store all our files together. Delete unwanted and unneeded items once you they feel they are unecessary.

Thanks for your patience.
